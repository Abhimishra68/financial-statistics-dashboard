# Chart Dashboard UI (Flutter)

This Flutter project demonstrates a modern, modular UI dashboard featuring various chart visualizations and a clean navigation structure. It's designed to showcase best practices in Flutter UI development, including component-based architecture and responsive design.

## Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** UI broken down into reusable widgets (`widgets/` directory).
*   **Chart Visualizations:**
    *   **Donut Chart:** Interactive or static representation of data distribution.
    *   **Line Chart:** Displays trends over time with multiple data series.
    *   **Bar Chart:** Categorical data comparison.
*   **Theming:** Centralized theme management for consistent styling.
*   **Tab Navigation:** Intuitive top navigation for different dashboard sections.
*   **User Profile Section:** Placeholder for user information display.
